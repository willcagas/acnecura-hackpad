## June 30th - 5 Hours
- decided to focus on a tool used to aid to with labeling data
- searched up shortcuts and useful keys for Roboflow

- started learning how to use KiCAD and drawing schematics and using the pcb builder
- experimented with different switches and found out how to utilize a matrix to 9 different switches

- downloaded all the footprint libraries and symbols
- had to learn to create my own symbol for the OLED

- set up optimal pcb board layout for most ergonomic layout for my hands to use for annotation
- rewired the entire schematic in order to create organized wiring on the pcb (was a complete mess previously)

## July 1st - 6 Hours
- created bottom case for pcb
- messed up the measurements multiple times through misreading the tutorial which resulted in uneven dimensions i had to fix (e.g. edges of outer rectangle to edges of inner rectangle were correctly 9.5 mm for the left and top side but messed up on the bottom and right side to 10.5 mm)

- created top cover for pcb
- got confused on how to measure the pcb components in kicad to get the right measurements on autodesk (i.e measuring edge cuts from the pink, yellow, or gray lines) but i eventually figured it out
- spent way too much time ensuring i had the most precise measurements as possible
- came across issue where the keyholes were not extruding and spent 30 minutes searching through the internet only to find out that the dcf i imported was on its own sketch and not with the case i created and i had two sketches so it could not extrude the keys as they were separate

## July 2nd - 4 Hours
- wrote the code for the firmware
- had to create the step files for the pcb and had to offset the parts on pcb for 3d viewing for the keys, rotary encoder and oled screen
- put all of the files together in autodesk to export as one step file

- preparing all files for submission

Total time spent: 15 hours
